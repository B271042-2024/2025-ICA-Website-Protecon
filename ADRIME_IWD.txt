# information
deadline: 250404




# objectives
1. User can obtain a set of protein seq from a user-defined subset of taxonomic tree (e.g. glucose-g-phosphatase proteins from Aves)
2. analysis 1: determine level of conservation across the species within the taxonomic group -> generate report/plots
3. analysis 2: PROSITE for motifs in protein seq of interest -> generate reports/plots
4. do other analyses (EMBOSS etc.) that can add relevant bio info to the outputs -> generate reports/plots
5. provide an example dataset (G6P from Aves) to illustrate all functionalities
6. enables user to revisit previously generated data (cookie)




# workflow
#Page1 --main page
	- either here/main/help: github link to codes

Input1:		| protein family |		e.g. Glucose-G-Phosphatase (Click to use)

Input2:		| taxonomic group |		e.g. Aves (Click to use)

-----

Analysis1:	| plotcon/python tool |		info: to generate protein conservation level across species in query group	

Analysis2:	| motifs - patmatmotifs |	info: using PROSITE database to find motifs/domains


#Page2 --additional fxnality


#Page3 --about
	- overview how all is implemented (no examples of code) aimed at web developer audience
	- either here/main/help: github link to codes

#Page4 --help
	- biological rationale for what is implemented (not the underlying code)
	- either here/main/help: github link to codes




# directions
1. input1: use esearch, efetch, etc. (if possible drop-down bar) - Use NCBI API token
	- error handling: if not exist then, stop and message
	- error handling: if many then then, dropdown bar to select 

2. core function: see how similar the sequences via a graphical representation
	- EMBOSS plotcon OR
	- Python plot

3. decisions
	- filter seq inputs: taxonomic basis/number/sizes
	- filter outputs w ref for every alterations, specified outputs for the next process

4. analyses
	- clustalo
	- blast

5. key goal
	- biological insights to user

6. Example dataset

7. User's analyses store in MySQL database



# rules
Do
	- check if the tools used are available on the server (else: include download or sth)
	- hosted under: ${HOME}/public_html/Website/
	- PDO for SQL interactions
	- as part of website, a web page for "Statement of Credits": list in detail with links
		- sources of any code used (w or without modification)
		- which AI tools used & what for (should not be vague)
	- Submit a document from Learn w
		- B number
		- link to website (https://bioinfmsc8.bio.ed.ac.uk/~aivens2/MyLovelyWebsite/index.html)

Dont
	- No R
	- No python to interact with SQL (do from php using PDO)


# to achive > 50%,
- high user satisfaction (useful biological information resource)
- high quality UI (simple to use, structured, attractive visuals)
- tables/views required to support the functionalities
- useful comments to the code
- style changes via inline style option
- style changes via global style sheet
- extra fxn
- extra webpages involving significant dev o fcode
- add new functional aspects involving externally developed web tools
- add links to external web sites
- generate report/plot
- good interface
- link to GitHub repository for the website code
